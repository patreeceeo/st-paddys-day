    Throw away those Nikes and lace up some ghillies, 'cause the <i>jog</i> is up! There's a new fitness trend sweeping the world, from the green hills, to the sullen bogs. From the rugged highlands to the teeming cities. That's right, the world has gone mad for getting fit, the Irish way!
    </p>
    <p>
    Little known outside of the Emerald isle until recently, the Irish have long used the jig not only as a way to let loose and have some <i>criac</i>, but also as a way to get in shape, and even to travel from place to place, when there isn't a rainbow handy.

    On March 14th, it will arrive in San Francisco, just in time for St Patrick's day. We will meet at a pub (TBA), enjoy some beverages and loosen up our feet and tongues.

    It's gonna be a deadly good time!
