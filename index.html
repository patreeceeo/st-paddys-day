      <b>On March the 14th</b>, throw away those Nikes and lace up your ghillies, 'cause the world is going mad for getting fit, the Irish way!
      </p>
      <p>
      That's right, the <i>jog</i> is up!
      </p>
      <p>
      Soon it'll be San Francisco's turn. We will meet at a pub for good cheer and good beer, then we'll jig over to another pub. And repeat.
      </p>
      <p>
      It's gonna be a <b>deadly</b> good time!
      </p>
      <h2>F. A. Q.</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Are you out of your tree?</dt>
        <dd>Little known outside of the Emerald isle until recently, the Irish have long used the jig not only as a way to let loose and have some <i>criac</i>, but also as a way to get in shape, and even to travel from place to place, when there isn't a rainbow handy.</dd>
        <dt>Do I need to know how to jig?</dt>
        <dd>Blimey! Everyone already knows how to jig. You just put one foot in front of the other, and then jig! But if you still think I'm outta my tree, there will be a short demonstration to commence the festivities. So be sure to arrive on time!</dd>

        <dt>How much beer should I consume while jigging?</dt>
        <dd>While it is indeed important to stay hydrated, you don't need to consume Guinness &mdash; or any kind of alcohol, for that matter &mdash; whilst jigging.</dd>

        <dt>What shall be our route?</dt>
        <dd>
          It's still being finalized, but here are some of the locales being considered:
          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Pub</th>
                <th>Neighborhood</th>
                <th>Vibe</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Dovre Club</td>
                <td>Mission</td>
                <td>Dive bar</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>The Liberties</td>
                <td>Mission</td>
                <td>Upscale pub</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </dd>

        <dt>What are your qualifications to put on such an event?</dt>
        <dd>My name is Patrick.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Sincerely,<br><b class="large-text">PatricK</b></p>
